Initially we had structured our work as a standard Java project. However, due to the requirements of utilizing Spring Boot, we had to transform it to a Maven project. To facilitate this change, we created a new main branch, established a new Maven project, and integrated the latest versions of the classes from the previous Java project. This approach resolved compatibility issues with SpringBoot. For clarity and consistency, all the classes were pushed to this new branch by a single team member.

While the code was uploaded by one individual, these classes reflect collaborative efforts made on earlier branches. The old branches remain accessible within the repository for reference.

Moving forward, all future branches will be based on this updated main release.
